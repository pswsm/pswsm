### Hello everyone, this is Pau 👋
I'm currently working as a Backend Developer, but I've done Frontend too.

## - My projects 🌳
I've made many projects, the one I'm most proud of and the only one I've actually finished (🎉) is the fasta-cli-toolkit

When learning a new language I do a project about creating humans, you can fid it in the `cpp` repo somewhere and on the `rust` one too, but as far as I remember both are somewhat broken.

## - What I'm working on 🤔
I'm currently focused on rewriting [fasta-cli-tools](https://github.com/pswsm/fasta_cli_tools). I still I have a lot of spare time, so if anyone knows of a project that needs some help feel free to reach me 🙌

Also from time to time I migth update some things and do some PRs on tools or libs I use.

## - How to reach me 👽
You can send me a message to git@pswsm.cat 📭

Or find me on the fediverse at pswsm@mastodont.cat 🖧
