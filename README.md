### Hello everyone, this is Pau 👋
I'm currently working as a Backend Developer, but I've done Frontend too.

## - My projects 🌳
I've made many projects, the one I'm most proud of and the only one I've actually finished (🎉) is the fasta-cli-toolkit

When learning a new language I do a project about creating humans, you can fid it in the `cpp` repo somewhere and on the `rust` one too, but as far as I remember both are somewhat broken.

## - What I'm working on 🤔
I'm currently working on a gleam backend for a blogging web. you can find it on `pswsm-repo/gleam/sequences` (don't mind the name).

Also from time to time I migth update some things and do some PRs on tools or libs I use.

## - How to reach me 👽
You can send me a message to `git@pswsm.cat` 📭

Or find me on the fediverse ⁂ at `pswsm@mastodont.cat`
