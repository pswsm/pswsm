### Hello everyone, this is Pau 👋
I'm currently working as a Frontend Developer, but I can do Full Stack

## - My projects 🌳
I've made many projects, the one I'm most proud of and the only one I've actually finished (🎉) is the fasta-cli-toolkit
When learning a new language I do a project about creating humans, you can fid it in the cpp repo somewherem and on the rust one too (albeit both are broken afaik 🙁)

## - What I'm woring on 🤔
Nothing specific really, so if anyone knows of a project that needs some help feel free to reach me 🙌
From time to time I update some thing and do some PRs to fix tools I use.

## - How to reach me 
